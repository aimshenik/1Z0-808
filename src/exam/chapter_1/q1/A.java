/*
There are only three rules to remember for legal identifi ers:
* The name must begin with a letter or the symbol $ or _.
* Subsequent characters may also be numbers.
* You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word. As you might imagine, a
reserved word is a keyword that Java has reserved so that you are not allowed to use it.
Remember that Java is case sensitive, so you can use versions of the keywords that only
differ in case. Please don’t, though.
